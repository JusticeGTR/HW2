# HW2
# Homework 1
This is our second homework assignment in nu-chi-fsf-ft-03-2021-u-c! 

In this excercise, we were tasked with creating our own portfolio page to show to potential employers using advanced CSS and clean coding initiatives. 

Acceptance criteria:
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

This one was a bit of a struggle. CSS definitely gave me a few headaches. I set out to make it so that it loaded into my main image to set a tone and feeling. I'd like to add lo-fi music to it in a small player at some point if it isn't too unprofessional. I was trying to make the nav bar stick as you scroll and will add that when possible. All of the work images will be placeholders since I don't have anything yet.

## Usage

Navigation bar links to page sections.
Inspect to test responsive sizing.
All CSS functions should hopefully work, although some may still be in progress.
